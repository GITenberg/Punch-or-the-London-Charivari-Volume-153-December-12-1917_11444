    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>A "Company for Oversea Enterprises" has been formed in
    Hamburg. It has no connection with the German High Sea
    Fleet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A guinea a dozen is being offered for rabbits in the Isle of
    Wight. Most of them, however, are holding back for a War
    bonus.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Newcastle man who has been missing for eleven months has
    just turned up at his home. He excused himself on the grounds
    that the tea queue was rather a long one.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There are reports current of an impending strike of brewery
    workers in the North. Several employees have threatened to
    "Down Beer."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Confirmation is still awaited of the rumour that several
    food ships have recently torpedoed themselves rather than fall
    into the hands of the profiteers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The statement that Viscount NORTHCLIFFE has refused the post
    of Minister of Health is without foundation. It is no secret,
    however, that he would decline the position even if he should
    offer it to himself.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Double-headed matches are impracticable, according to the
    Tobacco and Matches Control Board. The sorts with detachable
    heads, however, will continue to be manufactured.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Norfolk fisherman with twenty-six children has been fined
    five shillings for neglecting seven of them. His offence is
    thought to have been due to oversight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the Lord Mayor of DUBLIN there is plenty of
    food in Ireland. In the best Sinn Fein circles it is thought
    that this condition of things points to an attempt on the part
    of the Government to bring discredit on the sacrificial
    devotion of the Separatists.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>So realistic has the stage become of late that in <i>The
    Boy</i> at the Adelphi, Mr. W.H. BERRY (we give the rumour for
    what it is worth) sits down to a meal of wood cutlets.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In order that no confusion may be caused among guests the
    Government has been requested to have a "take over" whistle
    blown in the corridors before they commandeer the next
    hotel.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It seems that TROTZKY is to have no nonsense. He has even
    threatened to make lynching illegal.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The <i>Neue Freie Presse</i> describes LENIN as the
    revolutionary with kings at his feet. He also seems to have
    several knaves up his sleeve.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Brixton lady has left the sum of four hundred pounds to
    her dog. It would be interesting to hear the family solicitor
    asking him whether he would take it in War Bonds or bones.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Timber Commission reports a grave shortage of birch, and
    a number of earnest ushers are asking, "What is the use of the
    censorship?"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is now declared that the high explosive found on Countess
    MARKIEVICZ'S "green scouts" was not intended for destructive
    purposes. Mr. DE VALERA, M.P., was merely going to eat it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Many grocers and publicans, it is stated, have already been
    combed out of the Welsh coal mines. Efforts to comb the others
    out of their gold mines are meeting with only indifferent
    success.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>British grit will win, declares Sir WILLIAM ROBERTSON. If
    some of our elderly statesmen will refrain from dropping theirs
    into the machinery.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The London Fire Brigade has been given permission to form a
    band. The lack of some method of keeping the crowd amused at
    the more protracted fires has often proved an embarrassment to
    the force.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The big elephant at the Zoo has been destroyed, says a news
    item. A maximum price for potted game is already being
    considered by the Food Ministry.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Charged with selling bacon that was bad, a firm of grocers
    pleaded that the stuff had been released by the Government. At
    first sight it looked as if it had merely escaped from
    custody.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The man who was last week charged at a London police court
    with posing as a Government official has been put back for the
    state of his mind to be inquired into.</p>

        Herodotus tells us, 'Sardis was taken and utterly

    find the famous account of the capture of Timbuctoo by the
    Roman Emperor Montezuma in the fourth Punic War&mdash;or was it

    <h2>AN ORDER OF THE DAY.</h2>

    <p>In my opinion the value of the stock letter has distinct
    limitations. What I mean to say is that if there is in a
    Government office a series of half a dozen standard epistles,
    one or other of which can be used as a reply to the majority of
    the conundrums that daily serve to bulge the post-bag of the
    "controller" or "director," the selection of the appropriate
    missive should not be left purely to chance.</p>

    <p>Last month I wrote to the Methylated Spirit
    Controller:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;Referring to the recent Methylated
        Spirit (Motor Fuel) Restriction Order, No. 2, 1917, I wish
        to know whether I am at liberty to use my car as a means of
        conveyance to a farm about ten miles away where the rabbits
        are eating the young blades of wheat. A friend has invited
        me to help him shoot them&mdash;the rabbits, I mean."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Well, that was lucid enough, wasn't it? But the reply was
    not so helpful as I could have wished. It opened intelligibly
    with the words "Dear Sir," but continued:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I am directed by the Methylated Spirit Controller to
        inform you that the employment of a hackney motor vehicle,
        not licensed to ply for hire, as a conveyance to divine
        service constitutes a breach of Regulation 8 ZZ of the
        Defence of the Realm Regulations."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Not a word about the rabbits, you see.</p>

    <p>I was so fascinated by the unexpected results of my first
    effort that I tried again, this time breaking new ground.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR SIR," I wrote,&mdash;"Referring to Methylated
        Spirit (Motor Fuel) Restriction Order, No. 2, 1917, am I at
        liberty to use my car daily to take my children to their
        school, which is five miles from my residence? The only
        alternative form of conveyance available is a donkey and
        cart, the employment of which means that my offspring would
        have to start overnight."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I received a quite polite but rather chilly
    answer:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I am directed by the Methylated Spirit Controller to
        inform you that the class of necessary household affairs
        for which methylated spirit may be employed as a motor fuel
        comprises the conveyance from the nearest convenient source
        of supply of foodstuffs, fuel and medical requisites,
        provided that they cannot be obtained without undue delay
        by any means of conveyance other than a motor car."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>My interest thoroughly stimulated by this time, I made yet
    one more attempt. I wrote:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;Referring to Methylated Spirit (Motor
        Fuel) Restriction Order, No. 2, 1917, I wish to sell my
        car"&mdash;which was true&mdash;"but how, as I am now
        practically debarred from driving it on the road, am I to
        give an intending purchaser a trial run?"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This was evidently a shrewd thrust, which required
    consideration, and I heard nothing for a fortnight, during
    which I disposed of the car to the proprietor of the local
    garage. At last the well-known O.H.M.S. envelope gladdened my
    eyes. The letter within it, apologetic but dignified in tone,
    is, I fancy, the most popular in stock. It said:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I am directed by the Methylated Spirit Controller to
        express regret that there is no trace of the correspondence
        to which you refer."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I left it at that.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>SUGAR CARDS AND WILLS.</h2>

    <h4><i>To the Manager of the Legal Department,
    "Punch."</i></h4>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I am one of the executors and trustees of the
    will of a relation who cannot, I fear, live for many weeks.
    Included in his property will be a sugar card; and to you, Sir,
    I turn for advice and guidance in the responsibilities which I
    am shortly to assume.</p>

    <p>1. Will the Government accept a sugar card (as they do War
    Stock) in payment of Estate Duty?</p>

    <p>2. What is the correct method of valuation? Does one
    calculate the market price by so many years' purchase based on
    one's estimate of the duration? Or will quotations be
    obtainable on the Stock Exchange?</p>

    <p>3. My relative has left it in the discretion of his Trustees
    to distribute a part of his estate for charitable purposes.
    Could the Trustees, under their discretionary power, hand the
    card to the Trafalgar Square authorities in reduction of the
    National Debt? Or ought they first to obtain the consent of the
    residuary legatees?</p>

    <p>4. There is a tenancy for life of part of the residue. If
    the card is comprised in such part, and the tenant for life
    became bankrupt, would the card vest in his Trustee in
    Bankruptcy? If so, what becomes of the remaindermen's rights?
    Perhaps the best plan would be to put on a <i>distringas</i>
    with the deceased's grocer.</p>

    <p>5. Have the Trustees power on their own initiative to lease
    the card for a term of years? Or should the approval of the
    transaction by the Court, under the Settled Estates Act, be
    first obtained?</p>

    <p>6. With whom do the Executors register the Probate, so as to
    perfect their title? Lord RHONDDA, Sir A. YAPP, or the
    grocer?</p>

    <p>7. On the true construction of the Finance Acts, 1894-1916,
    do you consider that a sugar card is "Free Personal Property,"
    or "Settled Property," or "An Estate by itself," or "Property
    in which the deceased's interest was less than an absolute
    interest." The card is apparently "aggregable" with something
    or other for the purposes of duty. Would this be the testator's
    furniture?</p>

    <p>Yours, etc., A CONSTANT READER.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;In the little village I'm thinking of
    it is a sight on no account to be missed to see the same old
    British Tommy shopping by telepathy. He doesn't speak their
    language and they don't speak his, and when the article
    required is not in the window or on the counter to be indicated
    by the thumb, a deadlock would appear to be inevitable. Our
    Master Thomas, however, never did realise what a deadlock is;
    he goes on till he gets what he wants. So you see them in
    pairs, taking up a stolid position at the counter, obstinately
    stating and re-stating their demands in a composite language of
    which the foreign element is almost negligible, until the
    merchant or his wife gives in and produces the article
    required. I know one simple soldier who managed to reconcile
    himself to the confirmed habit amongst the French people of
    addressing each other in the French language, but could never
    understand their addressing horses and dogs in such an
    unintelligible tongue. "If you want a dog to come 'ere, why not
    say 'Come 'ere!' and 'ave done with it?" Men may learn strange
    lingoes to humour their fellow-men, but how can any dog be
    expected to understand "<i>Viens ici</i>"?</p>

    <p>Three years and some odd months have not changed this point
    of view; and now for Thomas to find himself in Italy is only to
    discover another lot of unfortunate people who cannot
    understand or make themselves understood. A little thing like
    that, however, is not going to be allowed to stand between
    friends; already new words and phrases are being coined,
    mutually acceptable to both parties.</p>

    <p>The first sign I saw of our arrival in this country was a
    derelict mess-tin on a country station platform; at the next
    station I saw a derelict rifle; at the next a whole derelict
    kit, and lastly a complete-in-all-parts derelict soldier. He
    was surrounded by a small crowd of native men, women and
    children, anxious to show their appreciation of his nation by
    assisting himself. They were doing their utmost to ascertain
    his needs; they were trying him with slices of bread, a
    <i>fiasco</i> of chianti, words of intense admiration, flowers.
    It was none of these things he wanted; he had only missed his
    train and wanted to know what to do about it. But how were they
    to know that? When a Latin misses his train he doesn't sit down
    stolidly and think slowly.</p>

    <p>I went to his aid. From the manner in which he rose to
    salute me they guessed that I was the Commander-in-Chief of all
    the English, and were for giving me an ovation. Thomas
    explained his trouble to me in half-a-dozen words; I solved it
    for him in even fewer. Thomas and I quite understood each
    other, and there was no want of sympathy and fellow-feeling
    between us. To the small crowd, however, this was the extreme
    of brutal curtness. They now thought I was of the English
    <i>carabinieri</i>, and that Thomas was being led off to his
    execution. They were visibly cowed.</p>

    <p>But the situation is not so simple and clearly defined as it
    was in the first place. In the old days either we were English
    and they weren't, or they were French and we weren't. There was
    no <i>tertium quid</i>. Now things are more complicated. As
    Thomas and I stood on the platform, loving each other silently
    and unostentatiously, a cheery musical train of <i>poilus</i>
    laboured into the station. There was nothing silent or curt
    about them: they were all for bread and chianti and flowers and
    ovations or any other old thing the crowd cared to offer.
    Anything for a jest and to pass the time of day. Between the
    French troops and the Italian crowd the matter was clear
    enough. Next-door neighbours, molested by the same gang of
    roughs in the same brutal manner, quite understand each other
    and the general situation when they climb over each other's
    garden fences to put the matter to rights. It was the presence
    of Thomas and myself which put such an odd complexion on the
    whole affair.</p>

    <p>Between ourselves and the crowd it was "Long live Italy!"
    and "Long live England!" Between the <i>poilus</i> and the
    crowd it was "Long live Italy!" and "Long live France!" But
    between the <i>poilus</i> and ourselves there were no signs of
    any desire that England or France might endure another day. And
    yet the crowd couldn't suppose that we didn't like each other,
    for the knowing looks which passed between the hilarious
    <i>poilu</i> and slowly smiling Thomas clearly indicated some
    strange and intimate relation. The crowd just didn't know what
    to make of it all and what exactly was between these odd
    strangers, who seemed to have everything in common but nothing
    to say to each other. For ourselves, I think it made us feel
    homesick, and the home which Thomas and I felt sick for (if you
    can believe it of us) was a certain estaminet we know of and a
    cup of caffy-o-lay. It was at this moment I first realised
    that, as between England and France, there are no longer such
    things as foreigners; either we've become French or they've
    become English, or else the two of us have combined into a new
    mixture which hasn't yet got a name to it.</p>

    <p>I think, though one doesn't talk much out here about
    glorious alliances, some deep feelings were being felt all
    round. Diversion was ultimately provided by the arrival of an
    imposing figure in dark blue, with a lot of gilt about him. The
    <i>poilu</i> put him down as an Italian cavalry officer, and
    expressed the further hope that Italy would endure for ever.
    The Italian crowd took him for something English, but not being
    able to judge whether he was greater or less than myself,
    contented themselves with an attitude of non-committal
    reverence all round. Thomas informed me that he was a French
    Staff Officer and displayed no further interest. Though I
    cannot tell you what in the name of goodness he was doing in
    those parts, he was in fact an American Naval Officer,</p>

    <p>In short, Charles, alliances are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page395"
       id="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span> things as wonderful to see
       as they are magnificent to read about. I do, however, regard
       with something approaching alarm the new language which will
       be evolved to put the lot of us on complete speaking
       terms.</p>

    <h2>THE PLAY'S THE THING.</h2>

    <p>Just outside Mrs. Ropes' drive gates there lies a famous and
    exclusive golf course, and when she turned her house into a
    Convalescent Home the secretary wrote offering the hospitality
    of the club to all officers who might come under her care.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, when Haynes and I first arrived, we were both
    too languid and feeble for any more exacting form of athletics
    than spillikins and jigsaws, and it was some time before the
    M.O. gave us permission to go on the links.</p>

    <p>"And remember," he added, "gently to begin with. Stop at the
    thirteenth hole."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Of course," I said apologetically to Haynes as we neared
    the club-house, "I was pretty putrid before the War, so I shall
    be simply indescribable now."</p>

    <p>"My dear chap, this isn't going to be a match. Keep your
    excuses till we play serious golf. To-day's just a gentle knock
    round. Here we are. I'll go and borrow some clubs; you get a
    couple of caddies."</p>

    <p>Five minutes later he rejoined me, carrying two sets of
    clubs.</p>

    <p>"Hallo!" he remarked in surprise. "I didn't know you'd
    brought your family. Introduce me."</p>

    <p>"Mabel," I said, "and Lucy&mdash;our caddies."</p>

    <p>"Girls?"</p>

    <p>"They have that appearance. Why not?"</p>

    <p>"They'll cramp my style horribly; I like to be free."</p>

    <p>"Can't you be free in French for once?"</p>

    <p>"Most unsatisfying. Why didn't you get boys?"</p>

    <p>"The caddy-master says (<i>a</i>) girls are better;
    (<i>b</i>) he has no boys; (<i>c</i>) all the boys he has are
    booked by plutocrats with season tickets."</p>

    <p>"Oh, all right. Here are your clubs&mdash;the pro. gave me
    the only two sets he had available. You're a bit taller than I
    am, so I've given you the long ones."</p>

    <p>I looked at them critically.</p>

    <p>"Doesn't a pair of stilts go with them?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Well, mine are worse. Just a bundle of toothpicks. Here,
    catch hold, Lucy."</p>

    <p>Mabel teed up for me. I selected a driver about the length
    of a telegraph pole and swept my ball away. It stopped just
    short of the first bunker.</p>

    <p>Haynes bent himself double to address his ball, but
    straightened up while swinging and missed it by a foot. At the
    second attempt he hooked it over square-leg's head on to the
    fairway of the eighteenth hole.</p>

    <p>"<i>Sacr&eacute; bleu!</i>" he said with very fair freedom,
    "I'm not going all that way after it. Lucy, run and fetch it,
    there's a dear."</p>

    <p>Lucy, highly scandalized at the idea of losing a hole so
    tamely, started off; Mabel and Haynes and I went after my
    ball.</p>

    <p>I took the mashie, because I distrusted my ability to carry
    the bunker with another telegraph pole. That mashie would have
    been about the right length for me if I could have stood on a
    chair while making my stroke. As it was it entered the ground
    two feet behind the ball and emerged, with a superb divot, just
    in front.</p>

    <p>"Aren't there <i>any</i> short clubs in the bag, Mabel?" I
    asked. She handed me a straight-faced putter ...</p>

    <p>Five strokes later I picked my ball up out of the
    bunker.</p>

    <p>"I'm over-exerting myself," I said. "We'll call that hole a
    half."</p>

    <p>Neither of us was satisfied with his tee shot at the next
    hole. I picked my ball out of a gorse-bush, and Haynes rescued
    his from a drain. Then we strolled amicably towards the third
    tee. Our caddies, unused to such methods, followed
    reluctantly.</p>

    <p>"Was that 'ole 'alved, too, Sir?" piped Mabel with anxious
    interest.</p>

    <p>"It's a nice point. I hardly know. Why?"</p>

    <p>She hung her head and blushed. A sudden suspicion struck
    me.</p>

    <p>"Mabel," I said sternly, "are you&mdash;<i>can</i> you
    be&mdash;<i>betting</i> on this game?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," she answered with a touch of defiance. "Boys
    always does."</p>

    <p>I told Haynes, who appeared profoundly shocked.</p>

    <p>"Good G&mdash;&mdash;! I mean, <i>Mon dieu!</i>" he
    exclaimed. "What are we doing?"</p>

    <p>"Surely you can't hold us responsible? The child's parents
    ..."</p>

    <p>"I don't mean <i>that</i>, you ass. Here we have the
    innocent public putting its money on our play, and we're
    treating the whole thing as a joke. This has got to be a match,
    after all. A woman's fortune hangs upon the issue&mdash;doesn't
    it, Lucy?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," she answered without comprehension.</p>

    <p>From this point the game became a grim struggle. I won the
    third hole in seventeen, but Haynes took the fourth in nineteen
    to my twenty-two.</p>

    <p>At the fifth I noticed a pond guarding the green. I
    carefully circumvented this with my faithful putter and holed
    out in my smallest score of the round so far.</p>

    <p>"Hi!" shouted Haynes. "How many?" He had been having a
    little hockey practice by himself in the rough, and was now
    preparing to play an approach shot across the pond.</p>

    <p>"Twelve!"</p>

    <p>"Then I've this for the hole," he yelled, and topped his
    ball gently into the water ...</p>

    <p>So it went on&mdash;what the papers call a ding-dong
    struggle. Suffice it to say that at the twelfth I was dormy one
    and in a state of partial collapse.</p>

    <p>The thirteenth is a short hole. You drive from a kind of
    pulpit, and the green is below you, protected by large
    stiff-backed bunkers like pews.</p>

    <p>"Last hole, thank Heaven," panted Haynes. "I couldn't bear
    much more. I'm all of a dither as it is."</p>

    <p>Mabel, twittering with excitement, teed up. I looked at the
    green lying invitingly below and took that gigantic putter. The
    ball, struck with all my little remaining strength, flew
    straight towards the biggest bunker, scored a direct hit on the
    top of it, bounced high in the air&mdash;and trickled on to the
    green.</p>

    <p>Haynes invoked the Deity (even at that stressful moment, to
    his eternal credit, in French) and took his miniature driver.
    His ball, hit much too hard, pitched in the same bunker,
    crossed it, climbed up the face of it, and joined mine on the
    green. Utterly unnerved, we toddled down and took our putts.
    Haynes, through sheer luck (as he admits), laid his ball stone
    dead; I had a brain-storm and over-ran the hole, leaving myself
    a thirty-foot putt for the match. I took long and careful aim,
    but my hands were shaking pitifully. The ball started on a
    grotesquely wrong line, turned on a rise in the ground,
    cannoned off a worm-cast and plopped into the tin. Mabel gave a
    shriek of joy, and Lucy&mdash;well, I regret to say that Lucy
    made use of a terse expression the French equivalent of which
    her employer had been at great pains to remember. Haynes and I
    lay flat on the ground, overcome as much by emotion as by our
    physical weakness.</p>

    <p>At last I struggled to a sitting posture.</p>

    <p>"Mabel," I croaked, "I shall want at least ten per cent.
    commission for that. How much have you won?"</p>

    <p>"Please, Sir," she cooed happily, "a 'a'p'ny, Sir."</p>

    <h2>A NEW USE FOR LATIN.</h2>

    <h3>BY OUR CLASSICAL EXPERT.</h3>

    <p>"Greek is in the last ditch," writes Sir HENRY NEWBOLT in
    his <i>New Study of English Poetry</i>; "Latin is trembling at
    sight of the thin edge of the wedge." Still a hope of saving
    Latin&mdash;within limits&mdash;yet remains, if the appeal of
    "Kismet" in <i>The Spectator</i> meets with a sympathetic
    response. He asks the readers of that journal "to render into
    Latin in two or three words the old cricket adjuration, 'Play
    the game.'" He has already had some suggestions, including
    "<i>Lude ludum</i>," from "an eminent scholar," but, like the
    late Mr. TOOLE in one of his most famous songs, still he is not
    happy.</p>

    <p>In rendering colloquial phrases into the lapidary style of
    ancient Rome, I confess it is often hard to improve on the
    brevity of the vernacular, though the admonition "to keep your
    end up" can be condensed from four words to two in "<i>sursum
    cauda</i>." Again the familiar eulogy, "Stout fellow," can be
    rendered in a single word by the Virgilian epithet
    "<i>bellipotens</i>." A distinguished Latinist recalls in this
    context the sentiment of the writer, Pomponius
    Caninus:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>Rebus in adversis comitem sors prospera
            pinguem</i></p>

            <p><i>Det mihi.</i></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And to the same authority I am indebted for the following
    version of "Don't speak to the man at the wheel:"&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>O silete, circumstantes</i></p>

            <p><i>Nautas rotam operantes.</i></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Though Latin is tottering at our schools it occasionally
    pops up in unexpected places. For example, not very long ago I
    heard a popular comedian introduce his family motto and
    translate it for the benefit of a music-hall audience. Latin
    quotations, even from HORACE, have gone out of fashion in the
    Houses of Parliament. Perhaps they will revive on the stage.
    The unfair preference for Greek shown by doctors in the
    nomenclature of disease is perhaps to be explained by the value
    of unintelligibility. Did not DAN O'CONNELL, in his famous
    vituperative contest with a Dublin washer-woman, triumph in the
    long-run by calling her an unprincipled parallelopiped?</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I appeal to the Editor of <i>The Westminster
    Gazette</i>, who, in his Saturday edition, has done so much to

             alt="" /></a>A STORY LACKING CONFIRMATION.
    </div>

    <p><i>Monday, December 3rd.</i>&mdash;No further publicity is
    to be given to Lord LANSDOWNE'S letter if the Government can
    help it. But the author is not to be prosecuted and the rumour
    that Lansdowne House has been raided by the police and its
    noble owner's type writer confiscated lacks confirmation.</p>

    <p>A long and complicated answer by Mr. CLYNES, describing and
    defending the new sugar-cards, was not altogether satisfying.
    Sir F. BANBURY'S inquiry, "Does the hon. gentleman think that
    anybody will get any sugar after this?" was prompted, no doubt,
    by anxiety for the future of his famous cakes; but it expressed
    the general doubt.</p>

    <p>Lord ROBERT CECIL, who has hitherto stoutly denied that the
    Allies have given ex-KING CONSTANTINE a retiring allowance,
    admitted that the Greek Government might make him some payment,
    and that the Allies furnished Greece with money. In other
    words, Greece has given TINO a penny to play in the next
    street, and the Allies have lent her the penny.</p>

    <p>Asked by Mr. GEORGE LAMBERT whether the labour expended on
    fitting gas-bags to motor cars could not be more usefully
    employed, the MINISTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE replied as follows:
    "The questions involved in the use of gas-bags, <i>including
    that raised by the hon. Member</i>, are being considered." And
    Mr. LAMBERT is now wondering whether Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES
    intended to be personal.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 4th.</i>&mdash;In answer to a question
    as to what steps the Board of Agriculture was taking to replant
    districts denuded of trees, Sir RICHARD WINFREY replied that
    "surplus nursery stock" would be transplanted by "gangs of
    women." Evidently surprised by the laughter which followed, he
    whispered to his neighbour, "Have I said anything very
    funny?"</p>

    <p>At the end of a long catechism by Mr. KING regarding the
    literature issued by the War Aims Committee, Mr. OUTHWAITE
    inquired if it could be sent to Members of the House. Major
    GUEST was quite ready to oblige. In his opinion some Members,
    including Mr. OUTHWAITE himself, would be much the better for
    its perusal.</p>

    <p>Mr. PRATT is about the last Minister whom I should have
    suspected of cynicism, but I have my doubts about him now. By
    his admission the British Pharmacopoeia (war edition) contains
    "Glycerins devoid of glycerin and syrups free from sugar."
    "But," he added, "it does not materially lessen their value as
    medicines."</p>

    <p>Upon the House being asked to recommit the Representation of
    the People's Bill in respect of the provisions dealing with
    conscientious objectors and redistribution in Ireland, Mr.
    REDMOND, naturally anxious lest the House should imagine that
    Ireland's objection to military service was conscientious,
    requested the SPEAKER to divide the debate into water-tight
    compartments. No artificial restraints, however, could keep Mr.
    HEALY within bounds. He ranged at large over Irish history, and
    declared that the decision to impose on Ireland a (more or
    less) equitable system of representation was an outrage only to
    be compared with the breach of the Treaty of Limerick.</p>

    <p>As a humourist on this occasion Mr. HEALY had to yield the
    palm to a colleague. The CHIEF SECRETARY incidentally referred
    to the arrangement that no contentious business should be taken
    during the War. "Except by agreement," interjected Mr.
    NUGENT.</p>

             alt="" /></a>SUGARLESS BANBURY CAKES.
    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday, December 5th.</i>&mdash;Not long ago Lord
    ROBERT CECIL referred to a rumour that the German Government
    intended to encourage polygamy. Mr. KING, shocked to discover
    that this charge rested upon a statement in a neutral
    newspaper, protested against the practice of making speeches
    "on such miserable foundations." As the bulk of the hon.
    Member's own utterances have a similar basis the retort was
    almost too obvious; and Mr. BALFOUR in making it must have felt
    as if he had shot his bird sitting.</p>

    <p>The courage of the hero who took up the challenge: "Whoever
    shall these boots displace, must meet Bombastes face to face,"
    was comparatively nothing to that of Mr. H.W. FORSTER, who in
    the interests of economy has promised to limit the height of
    women's boots. There will be much stamping of lofty heels at
    this ukase. Sir JOHN REES thought another order lengthening
    skirts was the logical corollary, and so it is if the
    Government really want "to make both ends meet." But Mr.
    FORSTER showed no disposition to embark upon petticoat
    government.</p>

    <p>Irish Nationalists worked themselves into seven different
    kinds of fury over the decision of the Government to apply the
    rules of arithmetic to the redistribution of seats in their
    beloved country. Mr. DILLON threatened the House with the
    possibility that at the next General Election he and his
    colleagues might be wiped out of existence. Scared by this
    awful prospect so many Liberals voted against the closure that
    the Government only escaped defeat by 29.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, December 6th.</i>&mdash;The prospect of an
    all-night sitting rendered the House unusually irritable. Mr.
    HEALY fulminated at Sir E. CARSON (who was not present) in
    language that reminded Colonel SHARMAN-CRAWFORD of "a low
    police-court." Mr. DILLON'S high top note was ceaselessly
    employed in emitting adjectives more remarkable, as Mr. BONAR
    LAW icily observed, for their strength than for their novelty.
    At one time it looked as if there was to be a first-class Irish
    row. But wiser counsels ultimately prevailed. The House as a
    whole was in no mood for protracted discussion in which
    non-Irish moonlighters might participate.</p>

    <p>At last there is hope that the instructions of the
    FOOD-CONTROLLER will have some practical result. To-day in
    reply to a question Mr. CLYNES said, "The order about to be
    issued will contain provisions ..." Ah! if it only will.</p>

    <h2>THE LOST LEADER.</h2>

    <p>The Hillsbury Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Lastshire
    Volunteers were being inspected for efficiency by a Captain of
    the Grenadier Guards, who had graciously come down and devoted
    his Sunday afternoon to this purpose. Forty "A" men had obeyed
    their country's call and turned up on parade, and among the
    officers was Alfred Herbert, who was a second-lieutenant of the
    mature age of fifty. He was enthusiastic, but a slow learner,
    always confusing himself and his men. Still, he was obviously
    doing his best, and the men forgave him and did <i>their</i>
    best to cover up his faults.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Herbert," said the inspecting officer sharply, "be good
    enough to take the company out and move them about for a few
    minutes."</p>

    <p>Herbert's heart began to beat at the double. He had known
    that this ordeal might come, but he had hoped against hope
    that, if he made himself small and meek, he would be
    overlooked. All was in vain; his time had come. "Drill them as
    a company of two platoons," said the stern Guardsman.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," said Herbert. "Shall I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Take them out at once, Sir. We have no time to waste."</p>

    <p>It was at this moment that Herbert's first dream, or I
    should rather say the first phase of his treble dream, began.
    He dreamt that he called the company to attention, caused them
    to slope arms, and moved them to the right in fours.</p>

    <p>So far so good.</p>

    <p>Now they were in columns of fours and marching gaily.</p>

    <p>"This is a good dream," thought Herbert. "I will get them
    into line. On the right, form company!" he shouted at the top
    of his voice.</p>

    <p>He had done it. He had got the rear rank in front, and this
    is a terrible state of affairs, leading to the most frightful
    complications&mdash;at any rate in the Lastshire
    Volunteers.</p>

    <p>"Move to the right in fours!" he commanded; and then the
    trouble began.</p>

    <p>In less than half a minute, forty deserving men, including
    N.C.O.'s, were tied up into a series of terrifically
    complicated knots, in the midst of which the Company
    Sergeant-Major bobbed about, an angry cork on a stormy ocean of
    desperate men.</p>

    <p>"Very good, Mr. Herbert, oh, very good indeed," said the
    Inspecting Officer.</p>

    <p>At this point Herbert passed into his second phase and
    dreamed that it was all a dream.</p>

    <p>But the question remained: what was he to do?</p>

    <p>"Double!" he shouted, and himself gave the example. And as
    he ran he passed into his third phase and dreamed it was all
    true; and he woke up with a start at the orderly room, and
    found that it <i>was</i> true.</p>

    <p>That very evening he resigned his commission, "owing," as he
    wrote, "to an incurable habit of getting the rear rank in
    front."</p>

    <p>What happened to the men I cannot say with certainty. I
    think they are still struggling.</p>

    <h2>MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS O'REILLY.</h2>

    <h3>ON THE DANGER OF POPULARITY.</h3>

    <p><i>The Ballybun Binnacle</i> has ceased publication&mdash;I
    hope temporarily, for I have had to fall back on <i>The
    Times</i>. The latter is the better paper for wrapping things
    in, and they seem to use a good kind of ink which does not come
    off on the butter, but it's a bit weak on its advertising side.
    It was O'Mullins across the road who pointed this out to me
    first. He had, he says, an advertisement a whole week in <i>The
    Times</i> for a total abstainer to make himself otherwise
    useful and to mend his stable door; but no apparent notice was
    taken of it. The same advertisement had not been a couple of
    hours in <i>The Binnacle</i> before three tinkers tried to
    steal his horse.</p>

    <p>I have heard people speak well of the editorials in our
    chief London rival, but they are not thought much of in
    Ballybun; they haven't the flavour. Our paper used to be
    strongly political, but the increase in the number of
    subscribers did not pay for the libel actions, and so of late
    we have been cultivating an open mind and advertisements. It is
    true that even so it was impossible for Casey, our editor, to
    steer wholly clear of vexed political questions, but his latest
    manner was admirably statesmanlike. He would summarise the
    opposing views of our eight or nine parties and then state
    boldly that he agreed with most of them, and as for the rest he
    would not shrink to declare, in the face of the world if
    necessary, that they were full of an intellectual Zeitgeist,
    unfortunately only too sporadic. He would then sum up by
    drawing attention to the bargain sale of white goods at the
    Ballybun Emporium. Everybody liked this, and the Ballybun Bon
    March&eacute; would send in its advertisement for our next
    week's issue.</p>

    <p><i>The Binnacle</i> has ceased publication, of course,
    before. When the editor took his summer holiday or went to a
    friend's wedding in the country he would often leave the
    bringing of it out to his staff. The latter used normally to
    edit the sporting and fashionable columns and was called
    Flannagan, but had only one eye and was somewhat eccentric.
    Flannagan couldn't be bothered sometimes and sometimes he would
    go fishing. Still, although the paper would not come out just
    when we expected, Flannagan might relent and bring it out two
    or three days later, and at all events he always told us the
    news whenever he met us in the street.</p>

    <p>Thus we could not strictly say that we had no local
    newspaper. But now, I fear, the case is altered, and <i>The
    Binnacle</i> has been killed solely by its own popularity.</p>

    <p>It doesn't do for an editor to be too popular. People used
    to drop in on Casey at all hours of the day and lend a hand and
    smoke his tobacco and try to borrow money. His sanctum became
    the fashionable lounge of the Ballybun <i>&eacute;lite</i>. A
    great gap was caused in the front of the paper amongst the best
    paying advertisements by Kelly's trying to clean his pipe with
    part of the linotype machine. Casey noticed this, and further
    attributed the matter to the Censor, whom he attacked
    vigorously in a leading article for trying to throttle the
    safety-valve of trade by inoculating the thin end of the wedge;
    he will do this again, he added, at his own peril. He also told
    Kelly the same.</p>

    <p>As our respected Member of Parliament is hanging tenaciously
    on to life, and we could not very well invite him to create a
    vacancy, we were at a loss how to mark our esteem for our
    popular editor in a practical manner. Casey himself suggested a
    testimonial. His friends, however, said that nothing sordid
    should ever enter into the feelings with which they regarded
    him, and decided finally on electing him to the second highest
    office a layman in our part can hope to hold. He was elected
    Judge&mdash;"unanimously," as he put it, "by 29 to 3"&mdash;and
    the race meeting came off last week. We hate to hold it in
    war-time, but the breed of horses and bookies must be kept up.
    Even the bed-ridden took a day off and trooped to it.</p>

    <p>Picture the feelings of the crowd when Casey merged the
    judge into the editor and kept declaring race after race a dead
    heat. They rose at him as one man and clamoured for souvenirs.
    What was left of Casey shook the dust
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page403"
       id="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span> of Ballybun off his feet,
       while our impulsive patriots were smashing his office
       furniture.</p>

    <p>This only proves what I have often maintained, that
    popularity always makes a man unpopular in the long run.
    Meanwhile <i>The Ballybun Binnacle</i> has ceased to appear,
    but I see from <i>The Times</i> there has been a movement in
    Berlin in favour of letting bygones be bygones.</p>

    <h2>ART TO THE RESCUE.</h2>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/404-1.png"><img width="100%"

    <p>No means to get people to invest in War Bonds can be
    seriously objected to; but I must confess that when, on a
    railway station hoarding, I caught sight of a poster
    representing WHISTLER'S famous portrait of his mother, with the
    words, "Old Age is Coming," printed across it, beneath an
    appeal to the public to be prudent about the future by buying
    Government stock now, I experienced a jolt. Because this
    picture has always been one of the sacred things, and to see it
    again was a necessary part of any visit to Paris. As to the
    shock which the sight would have caused the painter, were he
    alive to-day, the pen prefers to say little. Even with three
    patriotic motives to control him&mdash;for he was American by
    birth, French by sympathy, and English by
    residence&mdash;WHISTLER must have delivered his mind. That he
    would consider this anything but a gentle art of breaking
    enemies, is certain; nor can I see him holding his peace about
    it.</p>

    <p>Personally, however, I got over my own sense of the outrage
    very quickly. For the new War Bonds must succeed, and the end
    justifies the means, however desperate&mdash;that is how I
    looked at it, and therefore, instead of maintaining an attitude
    of preciosity, I began to wonder how I could assist the
    authorities (who had dared to bend the Butterfly to their
    purpose) to further useful acts of vandalism. Nothing should, I
    determined, stand in my way. Where they were merely "hairy," I
    would be absolutely bald-headed. Hence, if there is anything in
    the suggestions that follow which may set the teeth of the
    reverent on edge, it must be attributed to honest zeal. All
    that I want is for the Kennedy-Jones of the movement to lift
    Art from her pedestal for a few days only&mdash;in the
    interests of the Allies and to the lasting detriment of
    Germany&mdash;and then replace her. But there is no need to
    trouble about the replacing. That will be automatic.</p>

    <p>Beginning with the postulate that War's sinews must be
    forthcoming, or HAIG and BYNG will batter at the Hun to
    insufficient purpose, we can do anything. Let then, I say, all
    the artists be conscripted, whether old masters or young. The
    fa&ccedil;ade of the National Gallery is to-day one vast
    hoarding advertising the progress of the Loan; let us go inside
    and levy upon its treasures too. A few pictorial suggestions
    will be found on this page; others will occur to its
    habitu&eacute;s, and doubtless the Trustees (although Lord
    LANSDOWNE is one) will be only too glad to fall in with the
    project.</p>

    <p>BURNE-JONES'S "Cophetua and the Beggar Maid" hangs, for
    instance, in the National Gallery&mdash;temporarily borrowed
    from the Tate&mdash;at this moment. It would make a good piece
    of propaganda. "Why is the maid a beggar?" "Because her parents
    had not provided against the future by provident and patriotic
    speculation." Close by hangs, also on loan from the Tate, CECIL
    LAWSON'S "Harvest Moon." "Why on this most favourable of nights
    is there no raid?" "Because the success of the War Bonds
    brought about Germany's surrender." After the authorities' most
    admirable and desirable way with WHISTLER'S mother, you can do
    anything and should do anything. That is my point.</p>

    <div class="figright"

    <p>And not only the National Gallery, but the galleries of
    France and Italy, and even Germany herself. Perhaps Germany
    first of all, for there would be a piquancy in thus employing
    the cherished possessions of the foe. Could not something be
    done, for example, with the famous wax bust, the glory of the
    Kaiser Friedrich Collection, into which LEONARDO DA VINCI, as a
    finishing touch, crammed an early Victorian waistcoat before
    delivering the masterpiece to its owner? A really ingenious
    organiser should be able to make telling use of that, perhaps
    with a play on the word "investment." But meanwhile LEONARDO
    would, I am sure, be only too willing to suppress his sensitive
    feelings and assist his fellow-countrymen in their stand on the
    Piave by contributing "Monna Lisa." Some such words as these
    would serve: "Why is she smiling that satisfied smile?"
    "Because she has bought a nice little packet of War Bonds and
    thus insured a comfortable old age." At the same time TITIAN
    could help to save his Venice by lending the "Venus" from the
    Uffizi. "Why is this lady so naked?" "Because she neglected to
    invest in War Bonds, and thus had nothing with which to buy
    clothes later on." Or, if a French or English picture were
    preferred, INGRES' "La Source," from the Louvre, or LEIGHTON'S
    "Bath of Psyche" from the National Gallery, could be used with
    the same touching legend. But I feel that TITIAN should have
    the first chance. And there are living painters too who would
    come in. Our own old master&mdash;AUGUSTUS JOHN (who is now, I
    am told, a major)&mdash;would, no doubt, be delighted to lend
    the hoardings one of the pictures from his exhibition now in
    progress. The portrait of Mr. G.B. SHAW, for example, in which
    the eyes of the great seer are closed. "Why is this old
    gentleman not looking at you?" "Because he is afraid you may
    not have bought any War Bonds and he can't bear to see anything
    unpatriotic."</p>

    <p>But enough has been said. The National War Bonds must be
    sold, and Art must help, and no one must wince.</p>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Many years ago, when I was younger and more optimistic than
    to-day, I thought out what struck me as an adventure-story of
    wonderful promise, and confided the plot to a friend, reputed
    expert in such matters. He heard me with indulgent attention
    and, when I had finished, "Capital," says he; "but do you
    propose to differentiate it in <i>any</i> way from <i>Dead
    Man's Rock?</i>" I am reminded of this ancient wound by the
    appearance of a new buccaneering book by Sir ARTHUR
    QUILLER-COUCH; and that not only on account of the name of the
    author, but because when a tale of this kind begins in Bristol
    Docks, with a company that includes an apprentice-hero, a
    one-eyed sailor and a parrot of piratical past, it is
    impossible not to recall <i>Treasure Island</i>. However this
    may be, <i>Mortallone</i> soon attains a development quite
    sufficiently original, with an island and a secret and a noble
    store of buried treasure, all in doubloons and pieces of eight,
    which is exactly how I prefer it. In short a capital yarn,
    which did but confirm me in an old resolve that, were I ever
    thinking of commencing pirate or starting any unlawful business
    of the seas, I should avoid apprentices like the plague. The
    second part of <i>Mortallone and Aunt Trinidad</i> (ARROWSMITH)
    I found rather less satisfactory. Here a number of tales of the
    Spanish Main are supposed to be told by a trio of withered
    beldames whose youthful prime was spent as pirate queens. A
    striking and novel approach; though my belief in it was
    hindered by the discovery that these untutored crones not only
    spoke but wrote an admirable, if slightly mannered, prose, akin
    to that of STEVENSON or, say, Sir ARTHUR himself. But these be
    the carpings of age; I am sure that no boy lucky enough to find
    <i>Mortallone</i> among his Christmas presents will leave a
    paragraph undevoured.</p>

    <p>Dr. H. STUERMER is one of that small band of Germans who
    have had the courage to denounce the policy and acts of their
    Government. When the War began he joined the German army,
    fought in the Masurian operations, was invalided out of the
    army at the beginning of 1915, and thereupon became
    correspondent in Constantinople of the <i>K&ouml;lnische
    Zeitung</i>, in which capacity he acted until the end of 1916,
    when his too great truthfulness proved distasteful to his
    employers and he had to give up his place. Now he resides in
    Switzerland and "makes use," he says, "of the opportunity ...
    to range himself boldly on the side of truth, and show that
    there are still Germans who find it impossible to condone, even
    tacitly, the moral transgression and political stupidity of
    their own and an allied Government." This is a big undertaking,
    but Dr. STUERMER attacks it manfully in his book, <i>Two War
    Years in Constantinople</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON). He gives a
    harrowing description of the sufferings of the Armenians, and
    leaves no doubt that he considers Germany responsible for the
    massacre of a nation. I advise those who desire first-hand
    knowledge of the political schemes and ambitions of the Germans
    and their Young Turkish friends to consult this book. It is a
    mine of information.</p>

    <p>Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL always packs his novels with sober
    stuff and redeems them from any trace of dulness by the skill
    with which he handles his theme, and by his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page406"
       id="page406"></a>[pg 406]</span> conscientious study not
       only of his characters but of the details of his background.
       That background in <i>The Dwelling-Place of Light</i>
       (MACMILLAN) is an American cottonmill district with a mixed
       alien population of operatives, and trouble brewing as the
       result of a headstrong wage-cutting manager, <i>Claude
       Ditmar</i>, in conflict with the I.W.W. The phases of this
       grim struggle are most forcibly described, the author
       holding no brief for either protagonist. And, if widower
       <i>Ditmar</i>, man of iron, for whom the Chippering Mill is
       his second and abiding mate, be no hero, <i>Janet</i>, his
       typist, has the makings of a notable heroine. How this girl,
       full of character and of passion bravely restrained, breaks
       down the business preoccupation of her chief and how her
       courage and steadfast honour convince him that the liaison
       he promised himself will not suffice for honour or purified
       desire&mdash;all this is finely told. It was, however, but a
       faltering and slowly-growing conviction, and death claims
       him before he can make amends for the wrong into which his
       masterful pleading has betrayed her. I never quite precisely
       gathered what was "the dwelling-place of light." Anyway it
       wasn't the Chippering Mill ... But I was sorry when I
       reached the four hundred and ninth and last of the
       closely-set pages. Good measure for a book in war-time.</p>

    <p>Throughout a vagabond career that began in happiness on a
    farm and finished, thankfully, amongst the fields, <i>Frank
    Rainger</i> followed always the pathway of the broader
    experience. Followed it so stoutly and was such good company on
    the long road that whether it was high holiday at Cranbrook

    cause of the Southern States in shell-torn Vicksburg, or only
    the keeping of eternal lazy summer with the peons of Yucatan, I
    was altogether content to go humbly forward with him, convinced
    that, as it was written, so and no otherwise should it be. Even
    when he deservedly failed to become a shining light in the
    literary firmament to which he aspired&mdash;an unheard-of
    piece of audacity on the part of his authoress&mdash;I did not
    rebel. Miss SHEILA KAYE SMITH has an essential clarity of
    visualisation, a deep and still reserve of unforced pathos and
    an exquisite sense of the haunting word, that combine with a
    most competent alertness of movement to make her latest
    artistic success, <i>The Challenge to Sirius</i> (NISBET), a
    book for which I can hardly find adequate words of praise. Most
    admirable of all, perhaps, is a strange faculty she has shown
    for making one satisfied that her people should remain
    perennially rather poor and unambitious and dull, and should
    even grow old without occasioning us regret. With the deep
    under-drift of the writer's philosophy one may not be
    completely in accord, but certainly it will worry nobody, while
    the unity and beauty of her methods hold one in willing bondage
    from beginning to end. This is real literature, and everyone
    should read it.</p>

    <p>Without any very exceptional gifts as a story-teller
    Fleet-Surgeon T.T. JEANS, R.N., scores heavily off most writers
    of boys' adventure tales by having actually lived the life he
    describes. Here, for instance, in <i>A Naval Venture</i>
    (BLACKIE) we do get the real thing, and boys would be
    well-advised to sample it and see if it is not preferable to
    the kind of adventurous fiction produced so prolifically for
    their amusement. Not that this yarn is lacking in adventure;
    indeed it is concerned with the Gallipoli campaign, from the
    landings until the evacuation, and anything more adventurous it
    would be hard to imagine. In reading this story of <i>The
    Orphan, The Lamp-post, Bubbles, The Hun, Rawlins and The Pink
    Rat</i>, one feels that the author actually knows these
    "snotties," with their high courage, animal spirits and
    elementary humour. It is in fact history spiced with fiction.
    Of all the characters my vote goes to <i>Kaiser Bill</i>, for
    although, being a tortoise, he performed no deeds of actual
    gallantry, he carried good luck with him wherever he went.
    Besides, his name might annoy the ALL-HIGHEST. Mr. JEANS made
    an extremely good shot when he drew his bow at <i>A Naval
    Venture</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>You would hardly believe what a remarkably unprincipled set
    of persons make up the cast of Mr. WILLIAM CAINE'S newest
    story. He calls them <i>Drones</i> (METHUEN), but that, I feel,
    is a charitable understatement. There was <i>Eric
    Wanstanley</i>, rising young sculptor, who, because he didn't
    rise quickly enough, was capable of borrowing the savings of
    his friend's parlourmaid to work a system at roulette. The
    friend, <i>Austin Jenner</i>, was also an artist and also
    rising. His little failing was concealment of the fact that he
    was almost wholly supported by remittances furnished by his
    hard-working brother. Incidentally he was engaged to
    <i>Eric's</i> sister, but abandoned her without a qualm for the
    beringed hand of one <i>Mrs. Meldrum</i>, a rich widow, known
    as The B.Q. (Biscuit Queen). Need I say that <i>Mrs.
    Meldrum</i>, moving in these circles, and with ambitions as an
    art patroness, lived in Cheyne Walk? Indeed the setting of the
    whole comedy is inevitably Chelsea. Having regard to the number
    of bad hats among the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, you will
    probably not be astonished to be told that their goings-on are
    excellently entertaining; though I cannot but think that to
    give both his leading lady and his <i>soubrette</i>, or Singing
    Chambermaid, the handicap of morally deficient young brothers,
    does look like laziness on the part of Mr. CAINE. Surely there
    exist other avenues to calamity. But it's an amusing rogues'
    comedy.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
